This subdirectory is to store samples of python codes (Jupyter lab) that perform various tasks of physical optics propagation. 
This is part of a course fo Adaptive Optics I am giving at th eUniv. of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, I.
I would like to cover:
1. free propagation (both near field and far field, i.e. in the Fourier or the real space)
2. lens focusing
3. four-f system
4. plenoptic camera

point 1 is almost done.
